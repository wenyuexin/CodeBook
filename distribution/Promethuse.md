# Promethuse

[Prometheus](https://github.com/prometheus) is an open-source systems monitoring and alerting toolkit originally built at [SoundCloud](https://soundcloud.com/). 

Prometheus's main distinguishing features as compared to other monitoring systems are:

- 多维度数据模型：a **multi-dimensional** data model (timeseries defined by metric name and set of key/value dimensions)
- 灵活的查询语言：a **flexible query language** to leverage this dimensionality
- no dependency on distributed storage; **single server nodes are autonomous**
- timeseries collection happens via a **pull model** over HTTP
- **pushing timeseries** is supported via an intermediary gateway
- targets are discovered via **service discovery** or **static configuration**
- multiple modes of **graphing and dashboarding support**
- support for hierarchical and horizontal **federation**
